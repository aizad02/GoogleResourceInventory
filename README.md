# Google Resource Inventory

A collection of scripts that extracts information from one, or more, GCP projects, that can be used for any kind of analysis.

This is not a google product or software

## Recommendations
- Use a Service Account that has ONLY read-only access, although this script does not change anything in the cloud, it's a good practice to give only the access needed
